## Task 0: Complex Queries with Joins

This directory contains the SQL scripts (`joins_queries.sql`) that demonstrate mastery of advanced SQL joins by implementing the following requirements:

* **INNER JOIN:** Retrieving all bookings and their respective users.
* **LEFT JOIN:** Retrieving all properties and their reviews, including properties with no reviews.
* **FULL OUTER JOIN:** Retrieving all users and all bookings, including unmatched records (simulated using UNION in MySQL).

These queries fulfill the core requirements for Task 0.
